# Why Cloud ?
  
Many companies have a hard time maintaining their data centres. It's also inconvenient for new startups to spend a huge amount on infrastructures. A data centre would mean buying a whole system with lots of RAM, CPU & other necessary hardware. Then, hiring some expert guys to setup the whole system & to maintain it. Security, electricity, etc. would add on to the expenditure. 

To make things easy, many companies rely on Cloud-Computing. Here, they just have to think about their work & not worry about un-necessary expenditure. Most of the Cloud Providers work on the agreement of **Pay-as-we-go**, which means that startups don't need a huge amount to setup their business.


# How to work on Clouds ?

Almost all clouds provide a nice GUI interface. However, companies don't prefer a GUI coz it can't automate things. For automation, CLI is used coz commands can easily be scheduled and hence, things can be automated.

# The Problem 

The problem here arises that different clouds have different CLI commands. Hence, it poses a problem for Cloud Engineers.

# The Solution

The solution lies in using a sing method which can be used for all the clouds. One such tool is Terraform. A Terraform code is similar for all clouds and it also helps in maintaining records of what all has been done.
